# VSD_SRAM_SKY130
This project focuses on design of 1024x32(4KB) SRAM memory with operating voltage of 1.8v 
and access time of less than 2.5ns using opensource Google-skywater(sky130) pdk technology and compiled using 
opensource compiler openRAM.The circuits(custom cells) which are required as input to openRAM 
are designed and simluated using opensource tools.


# Opensource Tools used:

1. Ngspice : Ngspice is an opensource spice simulator for electric and electronic circuits.For more info regarding ngspice installation and tutorial follow http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/ngspice-tutorial.html .

2. xschem : An opensource source tool for drawing schematics.It allows hierarchical representation of circuits.For installation and configurin with sky130 follow :
https://github.com/bluecmd/learn-sky130/blob/main/schematic/xschem/getting-started.md#installation-of-sky130-primitives-and-symbols .

NOTE: Any other schematic drawing tool can be used in place of xschem. Here installation of xschem is not required for running this project on your machine.

## Stability Analysis of 6T-SRAM cell : 
The stability analysis of 6T- SRAm cell can be defined by butterfly curve and Ncurve methods.

### Static Noise Margin Calculation of 6T sram cell using Butterfly method:
SNM is defined as minimum DC noise voltage needed to flip the cell state .It shows the stability of sram cell,used to measure the robustness of a cell which shows how well it can hold its data.
To find SNM we draw inverter charactersitics and its mirror characteristics. The resulting two lobe curves is called "Butterfly curve".
The SNM is defined as the length of side of largest square that can be drawn inside the lobes of butterfly curve.


**1. Hold SNM**

The ability of SRAM cell to retain the stored data in absence of word line is defined as hold stability and is calculated as Hold SNM.

**Circuit Diagram :**

![](https://github.com/Deepak42074/VSD_SRAM/blob/main/Schematics/Holdsnm.png)

**Simulation Waveform :**
<dl>
  <dd> Type below command in Prelayout directory </dd>
</dl>

```
$  ngspice Holdsnm.spice
```

![](https://github.com/Deepak42074/VSD_SRAM/blob/main/Simulation_Waveform/Prelayout/Holdsnm.png)

On drawing the square of largest size in the two lobes we get :
Hold SNM = min(SNMH,SNML)= 0.71V


**2. Read SNM**

Read SNM is used to measure read ability which is the ability to prevent the sram cell to flip the stored value while reading the stored value.

**Circuit Diagram :**

![](https://github.com/Deepak42074/VSD_SRAM/blob/main/Schematics/Readsnm.png)

**Simulation Waveform :**
<dl>
  <dd> Type below command in Prelayout directory </dd>
</dl>

```
$  ngspice Readsnm.spice
```

![](https://github.com/Deepak42074/VSD_SRAM/blob/main/Simulation_Waveform/Prelayout/Readsnm.png)

 On drawing the square of largest size between two curves we get: Read SNM = min(SNMH,SNML) 0.42V 


**3. Write SNM**

The minimum voltage required to feed new value into the sram cell is known as write margin.

**Circuit Diagram :**

![](https://github.com/Deepak42074/VSD_SRAM/blob/main/Schematics/writesnm.png)

**Simulation Waveform :**
<dl>
  <dd> Type below command in Prelayout directory </dd>
</dl>

```
$  ngspice writesnm.spice
```

![](https://github.com/Deepak42074/VSD_SRAM/blob/main/Simulation_Waveform/Prelayout/writesnm.png)

On drawing the square of largest size  between two curves we get : Write SNM = 0.72V

### Stability Analysis by Ncurve method:

Butterfly curve has some drawbacks like different analysis is required for write and read SNM ,do not provide any information regarding current flow in the cell.
All these drawbacks are overcome by Ncurve method. Ncurve provides read and write stabilities in single plot.

**Circuit Diagram**

![](https://github.com/Deepak42074/VSD_SRAM/blob/main/Schematics/Ncurve.png)

**Simulation Waveform :**
<dl>
  <dd> Type below command in Prelayout directory </dd>
</dl>

```
$  ngspice Ncurve.spice
```

![](https://github.com/Deepak42074/VSD_SRAM/blob/main/Simulation_Waveform/Prelayout/Ncurve.png)

The four parameters A,B,C,D on above plot of Ncurve  define the stability of 6T-SRAM cell.

1. Static Voltage Noise Margin(SVNM) : It is the maximum DC voltage at the node Q before its state flips.It is the volatge difference between point A and C.

    SVNM = V(C) - V(A) = 0.84 - 0.18 = 0.66V
    
2. Static Current Noise Margin (SINM) : It is the peak current between first two crossing and it is the maximum tolerable DC current that can be injected into the SRAM cell     before its flip.

    SINM = I(B) = ~299 uA
    
3. Write Trip Voltage(WTV) : It is the voltage required before changing the contents of the internal node.It is the voltage difference between netween point C and E.
   
   WTV = V(E) - V(C) = 1.8 - 0.84 = 0.97
   
4. Write Trip Current(WTI) : It is the negative current which si needed to write the cell.
   
   WTI = I(D) = ~(-48 uA)
   
In Ncurve point A and E are stable points and point C is metastable point.
