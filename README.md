# VSD_SRAM
This project focuses on design of 1024x32(4KB) SRAM memory with operating voltage of 1.8v 
and access time of less than 2.5ns using opensource sky130 pdk technology and compiled using 
opensource compiler openRAM.The circuits(custom cells) which are required as input to openRAM 
are designed and simluated using opensource tools.
